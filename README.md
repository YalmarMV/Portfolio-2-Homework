Portfolio-Webpage

Welcome to my first portfolio website, where i am able to introduce myself and show some of my adventures back in my country. In this small project I was able to work more on my code skills and also create a webpage that is accesible for any user. 

I have added the correct syntax and semantics to the HTML and CSS files, making it easier to understand, by following the standard rules for semantic elements in HTML. Also I have cleaned up the CSS files in order to make it more organized and easy to read.

In order to look at the page, please check the following link:
